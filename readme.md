# React Boilerplate Using Webpack 4

My personal webpack 4 config set-up for developing in React. Followed the steps posted [here](https://auralinna.blog/) as well as the Webpack docs.

## Features

- Eslint included.
- Code splitting.
- Aliasing -- use `@` in imports to point to `/src/`.
- Favicon support.
- CSS Modules and SVG imports.
- Reach router included.

## To-do List

- Add Jest and react-testing-library functionality.
- Add service worker logic and mainfest file.
