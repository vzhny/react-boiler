My personal webpack 4 config set-up for developing in React. Followed the steps posted on https://auralinna.blog/ as well as the Webpack docs.

## To-do List

- ~~Fix aliases not working correctly.~~
- ~~Add a default favicon.~~
- ~~Fix broken svg imports.~~
- ~~Add reach router.~~
- Add Jest and react-testing-library functionality.
- Add manifest.json and service worker logic.
