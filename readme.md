# React Boilerplate Using Webpack 4

My personal webpack 4 config set-up for developing in React. Followed the steps posted on https://auralinna.blog/.

## To-do List

- Fix alias not working correctly.
- Add a default favicon.
- Add manifest.json and service worker logic.
- **Fix broken svg imports**.
